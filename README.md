# My portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio as a software developer. Most of this work was created while I was studying at The Iron Yard, Durham, NC during the Summer of 2015.

The app features my contact info in the header and footer, a brief self-summary, a collection of some of the projects I have worked on, and a downloadable copy of my resumé.

## Home

The home page features a picture of me and my short self-summary.

## Projects

All the projects have screen shots. All the projects are live on the web. All the technologies used to create projects link out to their respective web pages. Please keep in mind that during my time at The Iron Yard, we worked on many projects, but only some of those projects went into production level, on a live site.

## Resumé

This page will show you my resumé on the site. Anyone can download it by simply clicking on the image.
